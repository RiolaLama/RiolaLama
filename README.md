## Hey! 👋
I’m Riola, a web developer who enjoys building things that actually work well and make sense. I work on both the front end and back end, deal with databases, and focus on creating clean, efficient websites and applications.

I started out as a self taught developer, which gave me a very hands- on approach to problem solving. Over time, I’ve worked on different web projects, learning by building, breaking, and fixing things along the way.

Later on, I completed a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, which helped me organize and strengthen the knowledge I had already gained through experience. I also have experience as a programming trainer, which helps when explaining ideas or working with others, but my main focus is always on coding, building projects, and growing as a developer.
